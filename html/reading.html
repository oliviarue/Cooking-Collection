        <h2>Read the Recipe All the Way Through</h2>
        <p>Before starting, read the entire recipe from start to finish, including the ingredients list and instructions. This helps you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the steps and their order.</li>
            <li>Identify any unfamiliar terms or techniques.</li>
            <li>Check for preparation times or resting periods that could affect your schedule.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Understand the Recipe Format</h2>
        <p>Recipes are usually divided into two main parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ingredients List:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Lists everything you'll need, often in the order they're used.</li>
                <li>Measurements are crucial. Know the difference between teaspoons (tsp) and tablespoons (tbsp).</li>
                <li>Pay attention to details like "chopped," "diced," or "softened," which indicate how to prepare the ingredient.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Instructions:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides step-by-step guidance.</li>
                <li>Instructions may be numbered or written as paragraphs. Follow them sequentially.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Gather and Measure Ingredients (Mise en Place)</h2>
        <p><strong>Mise en place</strong> is a French term meaning "everything in its place." Before you start cooking:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>Measure and prep them as described.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Pay Attention to Timing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prep Time:</strong> Time needed to prepare the ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> Time needed to actually cook the dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest Time:</strong> Some recipes require resting after tooking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Add these together to determine the total time commitment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Check for Special Notes or Tips</h2>
        <p>Some recipes include additional tips, such as substitutions, storage advice, or serving suggestions.</p>
        <p>Look for these at the end of the recipe or in side notes. They can save time or improve your dish.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Know When to Multitask</h2>
        <p>Many Recipes involve overlapping steps, like boiling water while chopping vegetables.</p>
        <p>Look for opportunities to multitask to save time, but avoid taking on too much at once.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Taste as You Go</h2>
        <p>If the recipe allows, taste the dish at different stages to adjust seasoning.</p>
        <p>Be careful not to taste raw ingredients that may carry foodborne illnesses, like raw eggs or meat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Prepare for Adjustments</h2>
        <p>Cooking times can vary depending on your equipment or ingredient freshness. If something isn't turning out as expected, troubleshoot:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Too salty?</strong> Add acid (lemon) or starch (potaties).</li>
            <li><strong>Too thich?</strong> Add liquid (broth or water).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction">
        <h2>Review the finished dish.</h2>
        <p>Before serving, double-check the recipe's final instructions.</p>
        <p>Presentation matters. Serve in clean dishes with thoughtful plating.</p>
